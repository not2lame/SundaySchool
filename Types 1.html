                <td>
                    <span class="ref-header">Exodus 16:4, 11–15</span>
                    God provided "bread from heaven" to save the Israelites from physical starvation in the wilderness.
                </td>
                <td>
                    <span class="ref-header">John 6:35, 48–51</span>
                    Jesus declared, "I am the bread of life."
                </td>
                <td>
                    Just as manna sustained physical life daily, Jesus Christ sustains us spiritually. We must partake of Him daily (through prayer, scripture, and covenants) to receive eternal life.

                <td>
                    <span class="ref-header">Exodus 12:3–5</span>
                    A male lamb "without blemish" was sacrificed during Passover to save the firstborn from death.
                </td>
                <td>
                    <span class="ref-header">John 1:29</span>
                    John the Baptist saw Jesus and proclaimed, "Behold the Lamb of God."
                </td>
                <td>
                    Jesus was the only perfect (without blemish) being. His sacrifice saves us from spiritual death, just as the lamb's blood saved Israel from physical death.
                </td>

            <tr>
                <td><strong>The Brass Serpent</strong></td>
                <td>
                    <span class="ref-header">Numbers 21:4–10</span>
                    Moses lifted a brass serpent on a pole. Those bitten by poisonous snakes were healed if they simply looked at it.
                </td>
                <td>
                    <span class="ref-header">John 3:14–15</span>
                    Jesus taught that the Son of Man must be "lifted up" so believers can have eternal life.
                </td>
                <td>
                    Because of the Fall and our sins, we are spiritually "bitten." If we look to Christ (who was lifted up on the cross) with faith, we can be healed and live.
                </td>

                <td>
                    <span class="ref-header">Jonah 1:17</span>
                    Jonah was swallowed by a great fish and remained in its belly for three days and three nights before emerging alive.
                </td>
                <td>
                    <span class="ref-header">Matthew 12:38–41</span>
                    Jesus used Jonah as a sign of His own death and resurrection.
                </td>
                <td>
                    Jonah's time in the fish symbolizes Jesus's three days in the tomb. His emergence represents Christ's victory over death through the Resurrection.

            <tr>
                <td><strong>The Good Shepherd</strong></td>
                <td>
                    <span class="ref-header">Psalm 23:1–3</span>
                    David, a shepherd, wrote, "The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want."
                </td>
                <td>
                    <span class="ref-header">John 10:11</span>
                    Jesus declared, "I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep."
                </td>
                <td>
                    David protected his sheep from predators. Jesus knows His sheep by name, protects us from spiritual danger, and laid down His life to save us.
                </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td><strong>The Suffering Servant</strong></td>
                <td>
                    <span class="ref-header">Isaiah 53:3–5</span>
                    Isaiah prophesied of one "wounded for our transgressions" and "bruised for our iniquities."
                </td>
                <td>
                    <span class="ref-header">1 Peter 2:24</span>
                    Peter quotes Isaiah, testifying that Jesus "bare our sins in his own body on the tree."
                </td>
                <td>
                    This is a direct prophecy of the Atonement. Jesus suffered pain and rejection so that by "his stripes" (wounds) we could be healed spiritually.
                </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td><strong>Naaman’s Healing</strong></td>
                <td>
                    <span class="ref-header">2 Kings 5:1–14</span>
                    Naaman, a leper, was healed only after humbling himself to wash seven times in the Jordan River.
                </td>
                <td>
                    <span class="ref-header">Luke 4:27</span>
                    Jesus referenced Naaman as an example of faith among Gentiles.
                </td>
                <td>
                    Naaman wanted a grand miracle but was healed by a simple act of obedience. Similarly, we are cleansed from sin not by great deeds, but by simple obedience to Christ's ordinances (like baptism).
                </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td><strong>Isaac (The Son of Promise)</strong></td>
                <td>
                    <span class="ref-header">Genesis 22:1–14</span>
                    Abraham was commanded to offer his beloved son, Isaac, as a sacrifice. Isaac carried the wood for the offering himself.
                </td>
                <td>
                    <span class="ref-header">Hebrews 11:17–19</span>
                    Paul teaches that Abraham received Isaac back from death "in a figure" (symbolically).
                </td>
                <td>
                    This event is a "similitude" of God the Father offering His Only Begotten Son. Isaac (the son) willingly submitting to his father mirrors Jesus submitting to the Father's will in Gethsemane.
                </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>

                <td>
                    <span class="ref-header">Genesis 37–45</span>
                    Joseph was rejected by his brothers, sold into slavery, and later became the ruler who saved them from famine.
                </td>
                <td>
                    <span class="ref-header">Acts 7:9–14</span>
                    Stephen taught that while the patriarchs rejected Joseph, God was with him and used him to save the people.
                </td>
                <td>
                    Joseph is a type of Christ: He was the beloved son, was betrayed for the price of a slave (silver), and eventually became the source of "bread" (life) and forgiveness for those who betrayed him.
                </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td><strong>The Rock at Horeb</strong></td>
                <td>
                    <span class="ref-header">Exodus 17:6</span>
                    When the people were dying of thirst in the desert, Moses struck a rock, and water gushed out to save them.
                </td>
                <td>
                    <span class="ref-header">1 Corinthians 10:4</span>
                    The Apostle Paul taught that the Israelites "drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ."
                </td>
                <td>
                    Jesus is the "Living Water." Just as the rock was struck to release water, Christ was stricken for us so that His distinct power could flow to save us from spiritual death.
