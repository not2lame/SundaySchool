                <td><strong>Adam’s Sacrifice (The Similitude)</strong></td>
                <td>
                    <span class="ref-header">Genesis 4:4</span>
                    Genesis mentions Abel bringing "firstlings" but does not detail Adam’s understanding of <em>why</em>.
                </td>
                <td>
                    <span class="ref-header">Moses 5:5–7</span>
                    (Pearl of Great Price)
                    An angel explicitly teaches Adam that his sacrifice is "a similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father."
                </td>
                <td>
                    While the New Testament connects Christ to sacrifice generally, the Book of Moses reveals that Adam knew specifically that the animal represented the "Only Begotten." It establishes that the Atonement was central to worship from the very beginning of human history.

            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td><strong>The "Man of Holiness"</strong></td>
                <td>
                    <span class="ref-header">None</span>
                    The title "Son of Man" appears in the OT (Daniel 7), but its origin is not explained.
                </td>
                <td>
                    <span class="ref-header">Moses 6:57</span>
                    (Pearl of Great Price)
                    "For in the language of Adam, Man of Holiness is [God's] name, and the name of his Only Begotten is the Son of Man."
                </td>
                <td>
                    This restores the meaning of Jesus’s title "Son of Man." It does not simply mean "son of a human," but Son of the "Man of Holiness" (God the Father). It testifies of His divine lineage and holy nature.

            <tr>
                <td><strong>The Lord of the Vineyard</strong></td>
                <td>
                    <span class="ref-header">Jeremiah 11:16</span>
                    Jeremiah calls Israel a "green olive tree," but the full allegory of the Master’s labor is lost in the Bible.
                </td>
                <td>
                    <span class="ref-header">Jacob 5:4–7, 72</span>
                    (Book of Mormon)
                    The Prophet Zenos (an Old Testament prophet) details the "Lord of the vineyard" working tirelessly to save the trees.
                </td>
                <td>
                    Unlike the New Testament parables where the master often sends servants, here the "Lord of the vineyard" (Christ) labors <em>with</em> them. He weeps for the trees and works personally to preserve them, symbolizing Christ’s intimate involvement in our salvation.

            <tr>
                <td><strong>The Stone of Israel</strong></td>
                <td>
                    <span class="ref-header">Genesis 49:24</span>
                    Jacob prophesies of the "shepherd, the stone of Israel," but the identity is somewhat cryptic in the OT text.
                </td>
                <td>
                    <span class="ref-header">D&C 50:44</span>
                    (Doctrine & Covenants)
                    "I am the good shepherd, and the stone of Israel. He that buildeth upon this rock shall never fall."
                </td>
                <td>
                    Modern revelation explicitly identifies Jesus Christ as the specific "Stone of Israel" prophesied by Jacob. It connects the ancient patriarchal blessing directly to the Savior’s role as our sure foundation in the latter days.
                </td>
            </tr>
            
            <tr>
                <td><strong>The Keeper of the Gate</strong></td>
                <td>
                    <span class="ref-header">Psalm 118:19–20</span>
                    The Psalms speak of the "gates of righteousness" which the righteous shall enter.
                </td>
                <td>
                    <span class="ref-header">2 Nephi 9:41</span>
                    (Book of Mormon)
                    "The keeper of the gate is the Holy One of Israel; and he employeth no servant there."
                </td>
                <td>
                    This passage clarifies that Jesus does not delegate our final judgment or entry into eternal life to any prophet or apostle ("no servant"). He personally keeps the gate, ensuring that He knows and vouches for every individual who enters.
