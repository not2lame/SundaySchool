    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is now a three-part SPA. A main landing page offers "Daily Devotional," "Musical Companion," and "Weekly Study Companion." This structure cleanly separates interactive daily exercises, musical enrichment, and in-depth weekly study material. Each view is self-contained to prevent cognitive overload. The "Weekly Study Companion" is presented as a long-form, scrollable document, which is the most effective format for consuming a detailed discussion guide, as opposed to the tabbed daily views. This allows users to easily read, reference, and synthesize the complete lesson plan for the week. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The application now integrates three distinct content types. 1) Devotional & Music Views: Retain their tab-based, interactive structure for daily engagement. 2) Weekly Study Companion View: Uses structured, semantic HTML (headings, paragraphs, blockquotes) to present the long-form text from the Google Doc. Interaction: A primary JS view switcher manages navigation between the three main experiences. Justification: This multi-faceted structure provides the right interface for each specific type of content—interactive for daily tasks, and linear for deep-reading and study. This tailored approach ensures optimal usability across all sections. Library/Method: Vanilla JS for interactions, Tailwind CSS for styling. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                <h2>Introduction: Doctrine and Covenants 109–110</h2>
                <p>The doors to the Kirtland Temple weren’t supposed to open until eight o’clock on the morning of March 27, 1836, but a crowd of more than a thousand people started gathering hours earlier. Some had come from as far away as Canada, and many had sacrificed immensely to build this house to the Lord. After the people were seated, the services began, lasting for nearly seven hours. The climax of the day was the dedicatory prayer, now known as <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/109" target="_blank" class="text-amber-600 hover:underline">Doctrine and Covenants 109</a>. Following the prayer, the choir sang “The Spirit of God,” a new hymn written for the occasion by W. W. Phelps. As one person who was there reported, this was followed by a spiritual outpouring a “scene of glory” that was “beyond description.”</p>
                <p>One week later, on April 3, 1836, the Savior appeared in the temple to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery and accepted the sacred edifice. Then Moses, Elias, and Elijah appeared and committed priesthood keys to Joseph and Oliver, keys that are essential to the Lord’s work in our day.</p>
                
                <h3>Discussion Point:</h3>
                <p>The dedication of the Kirtland Temple was a monumental event, marked by an outpouring of the Spirit and attended by heavenly messengers. It was the culmination of immense sacrifice and the beginning of the restoration of temple blessings in our dispensation. The Saints on both sides of the veil rejoiced because a house of the Lord was once again on the earth, where God could endow His people with “power from on high.”</p>
                
                <h3>Discussion Question 1:</h3>
                <p>The manual notes the "great excitement—on both sides of the veil." Why do you think the dedication of a temple was such a significant and joyous event for both the living and those who had passed on?</p>
                <div class="possible-answers">
                    <p><strong>Possible Answers:</strong> For the living, it was a fulfillment of prophecy and the result of tremendous sacrifice. It was a tangible sign of God's favor and the place where they would receive promised power and blessings. For those in the spirit world, it meant that the saving ordinances would once again be performed on the earth, opening the door for their eternal progression.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Doctrine and Covenants 109 – The Dedicatory Prayer</h2>
                <h3>Discussion Point:</h3>
                <p>The dedicatory prayer for the Kirtland Temple, given by revelation to Joseph Smith, outlines the foundational blessings and promises associated with temple worship that are still available to us today.</p>
                
                <h3>Discussion Question (D&C 109:12-13, 22-23):</h3>
                <p>Joseph prayed that the temple would be a place where God’s servants could be armed with power, where His glory would rest, and where He could manifest Himself to His people. In what ways have you felt the Lord’s power or felt His presence in His house?</p>
                <div class="possible-answers">
                    <p><strong>Possible Answers:</strong> Members might share feelings of peace, revelation, or strength received in the temple. This could be related to specific covenants, personal trials, or feelings of closeness to God or family members across the veil. The power could be the strength to overcome temptation, the ability to fulfill a calling, or the peace that comes from an eternal perspective.</p>
                </div>
                <blockquote>President Thomas S. Monson taught, “As we attend the temple, there can come to us a dimension of spirituality and a feeling of peace which will transcend any other feeling which could come into the human heart. … It is a place of peace, a place of solace, a place of inspiration.”</blockquote>

                <h2>Hymn: “The Spirit of God”</h2>
                <h3>Discussion Point:</h3>
                <p>This hymn is a joyful anthem of the Restoration, celebrating the heavens being opened, the veil bursting, and the blessings pouring down upon the Saints.</p>
                <h3>Discussion Question:</h3>
                <p>As we sing or read the words to "<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/media/music/hymns/the-spirit-of-god?lang=eng" target="_blank" class="text-amber-600 hover:underline">The Spirit of God</a>," which phrases or promises stand out to you as being particularly relevant to your temple experience?</p>
                <div class="possible-answers">
                    <p><strong>Possible Answers:</strong> Phrases like "the veil o'er the earth is beginning to burst," "the visions and blessings of old are returning," and "the Lord is extending the Saints' understanding" all speak to the revelatory nature of the temple. Members might connect these phrases to personal insights or feelings of connection to the work of God.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h2>Doctrine and Covenants 110:1–10 – The Lord Appears</h2>
                <h3>Discussion Point:</h3>
                <p>After the dedication, the Lord Jesus Christ Himself appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. He stood upon the breastwork of the pulpit and accepted the temple, declaring that He would manifest Himself there in mercy.</p>
                
                <h3>Discussion Question 1:</h3>
                <p>The Savior’s appearance is described with powerful imagery: His eyes were as a “flame of fire,” His voice was as the “sound of the rushing of great waters.” (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/110.3#p3" target="_blank" class="text-amber-600 hover:underline">D&C 110:3</a>). What do these descriptions teach you about the character and majesty of Jesus Christ?</p>
                <div class="possible-answers">
                    <p><strong>Possible Answers:</strong> These descriptions convey His power, purity, and glory. A "flame of fire" suggests an all-seeing, penetrating gaze that can purify and cleanse. The "sound of the rushing of great waters" suggests immense power and authority, yet He came in mercy, showing both His might and His meekness.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h3>Discussion Question 2:</h3>
                <p>The Lord promises, “I will manifest myself to my people in mercy in this house” (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/110.7#p7" target="_blank" class="text-amber-600 hover:underline">D&C 110:7</a>). How is this promise fulfilled for us today?</p>
                <div class="possible-answers">
                    <p><strong>Possible Answers:</strong> While we may not have a physical vision of the Savior, He manifests Himself through the Holy Ghost. We feel His presence through peace, personal revelation, comfort, and the confirmation of truth. The ordinances themselves are manifestations of His mercy and love.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Doctrine and Covenants 110:11–16 – The Restoration of Priesthood Keys</h2>
                <h3>Discussion Point:</h3>
                <p>Following the Savior's visit, three ancient prophets appeared and committed essential priesthood keys to Joseph and Oliver, unlocking the blessings that define the work of the Church today.</p>
                
                <h3>Discussion Question (Verse 12 - Elias):</h3>
                <p>Elias committed the dispensation of the gospel of Abraham, which includes the celestial covenant of marriage. How does the promise that in our “seed all generations after [us] shall be blessed” influence the way we approach our temple covenants and family relationships?</p>
                <div class="possible-answers">
                    <p><strong>Possible Answers:</strong> This gives us an eternal perspective. It helps us see our marriage and family not just as a source of present happiness, but as a link in an eternal chain with promises that extend to our posterity. It motivates us to live worthily of those blessings and to teach our children the importance of the covenant.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h3>Discussion Question (Verses 13–16 - Elijah):</h3>
                <p>Elijah restored the sealing keys, which make it possible to perform all temple ordinances for both the living and the dead and to unite families forever. Why is turning our hearts to our fathers—our ancestors—so essential to God's plan?</p>
                <div class="possible-answers">
                    <p><strong>Possible Answers:</strong> Without them, we cannot be made perfect. God’s family is an eternal family, and the sealing power is what binds it all together. This work creates a "welding link" between generations, fosters love and gratitude for our heritage, and fulfills the promise that the whole earth would not be "utterly wasted at his coming" (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/2.3#p3" target="_blank" class="text-amber-600 hover:underline">D&C 2:3</a>).</p>
                </div>
                <blockquote>President Russell M. Nelson taught, “The heavens are open. The keys of the priesthood, restored in the Kirtland Temple, are on the earth. With those keys, we can rejoice! With those keys, we can be endowed with power from on high. With those keys, we can seal our families for time and for all eternity. With those keys, we can bring the blessings of the temple to our ancestors. With those keys, we can see the fulfillment of the Abrahamic covenant.” (“<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2024/04/51nelson?lang=eng" target="_blank" class="text-amber-600 hover:underline">Rejoice in the Gift of Priesthood Keys</a>,” May 2024)</blockquote>
