                <h2>Introduction: Resilience in the Face of Loss</h2>
                <h3>Discussion Point:</h3>
                <p>The introduction establishes a theme of resilience in the face of loss. After being driven from both Independence and Kirtland—losing homes, land, and even their beloved temple—and suffering from internal apostasy, the faithful Saints did not give up. Instead of focusing on their losses, they began building Zion again in a new place. This teaches us that discipleship isn't about avoiding failure or loss, but about our willingness to "rise again" and continue serving God.</p>
                <h3>Discussion Question:</h3>
                <p>The Saints had lost their temple, the center place of Zion, and some of their leaders. What can we learn from their example of continuing to build and make sacrifices even after experiencing such profound setbacks?</p>
                <div class="possible-answers">
                    <p><strong>Possible Answers:</strong> Their example teaches that our commitment to God's work should not be dependent on our circumstances. Faith is demonstrated by our actions during difficult times, not just during times of peace and prosperity. It shows that Zion is not just a place, but a people and a cause that we can build wherever we are, regardless of what we have lost.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h2>The name of the Church is important to the Lord.</h2>
                <h3>Discussion Point:</h3>
                <p>In this revelation, the Lord explicitly names His church: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. President Nelson has emphasized that this is a command, not a suggestion. The name is not cosmetic; it is a declaration of our core identity. It puts the Savior at the forefront of His own Church, clarifying who we worship and whose work this is.</p>
                <blockquote>Doctrine and Covenants 115:4: "For thus shall my church be called in the last days, even The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints."</blockquote>
                <h3>Discussion Question:</h3>
                <p>Besides simple obedience, why do you think it is so important, both for us and for the world, that we use the correct and full name of the Church?</p>
                <div class="possible-answers">
                    <p><strong>Possible Answers:</strong> Using the correct name is a form of bearing testimony. It declares to the world that we are Christians who worship Jesus Christ. It corrects misconceptions and helps distinguish us from other faiths. Internally, it reminds us that He is the center of our faith, our doctrine, and our lives.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Zion and her stakes offer “refuge from the storm.”</h2>
                <h3>Discussion Point:</h3>
                <p>The Lord uses powerful imagery to describe the purpose of His Church. The stakes of Zion are to be a defense and a "refuge from the storm." This is not a passive role. As members, we are commanded to "arise and shine forth," making our stakes places of light, safety, and spiritual strength that can be a "standard for the nations."</p>
                <blockquote>Doctrine and Covenants 115:5-6: "Verily I say unto you all: Arise and shine forth, that thy light may be a standard for the nations; And that the gathering together upon the land of Zion, and upon her stakes, may be for a defense, and for a refuge from the storm, and from wrath when it shall be poured out without mixture upon the whole earth."</blockquote>
                <h3>Discussion Question:</h3>
                <p>What are some of the spiritual "storms" we see in the world today? In what practical ways have you found the stakes of Zion—our wards and branches—to be a "refuge" and a "defense" from those storms?</p>
                <div class="possible-answers">
                    <p><strong>Possible Answers:</strong> Storms include contention, moral decay, confusion about identity, loneliness, and attacks on faith. The Church provides refuge through clear doctrine and prophetic guidance (a defense against confusion), a community of Saints who support each other (a refuge from loneliness), and opportunities to serve and feel the Spirit, which defends against despair and doubt.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>My sacrifices are sacred to the Lord.</h2>
                <h3>Discussion Point:</h3>
                <p>This revelation addresses different kinds of sacrifice. Newel K. Whitney was asked to leave his property and "covetous desires" behind. Oliver Granger was asked to stay behind and settle the Church's debts, a task in which he was not financially successful but was faithful. The Lord teaches that He doesn't measure sacrifice by worldly success. What matters is our willingness to give what He asks. God declares that Oliver Granger's sacrifice "shall be more sacred unto me than his increase."</p>
                <blockquote>Doctrine and Covenants 117:12: "And his name shall be had in sacred remembrance from generation to generation, forever and ever, saith the Lord."</blockquote>
                <h3>Discussion Question:</h3>
                <p>The Lord valued Oliver Granger's faithful sacrifice more than any potential financial "increase." How does this principle help you when the results of your righteous efforts and sacrifices—in your calling, in your family, or at work—are not what you had hoped for?</p>
                <div class="possible-answers">
                    <p><strong>Possible Answers:</strong> This principle is incredibly comforting. It teaches that God sees and values our effort, our intent, and our faithfulness, not just the outcome. It helps us find peace even when our best efforts seem to fail by worldly standards. We can have confidence that our sacrifice is accepted and sacred in His eyes, which is the only measure that truly matters.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h2>My tithing helps build the kingdom of God.</h2>
                <h3>Discussion Point:</h3>
                <p>These revelations establish the law of tithing as a "standing law unto them forever." Tithing is defined as one-tenth of our annual interest (income). Significantly, the Lord states that obedience to this law is a prerequisite for Zion; it helps to "sanctify the land of Zion." D&C 120 establishes the divine pattern for how tithing is administered: by a council composed of the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve, and the Presiding Bishopric, acting "by mine own voice unto them."</p>
                <blockquote>Doctrine and Covenants 119:4, 6: "And after that, those who have thus been tithed shall pay one-tenth of all their interest annually; and this shall be a standing law unto them forever, for my holy priesthood, saith the Lord... And I say unto you, if my people observe not this law, to keep it holy... behold, verily I say unto you, it shall not be a land of Zion unto you."</blockquote>
                <h3>Discussion Question:</h3>
                <p>The Lord says that obeying the law of tithing helps to "sanctify the land of Zion." Beyond the practical need for funds, how do you think the act of faithfully paying tithing helps to sanctify us as individuals and prepare us to be a Zion people?</p>
                <div class="possible-answers">
                    <p><strong>Possible Answers:</strong> Paying tithing requires faith and helps us overcome materialism and selfishness. It is a tangible way we put God first in our lives. This collective act of faith and sacrifice unifies us and purifies our hearts, making us more consecrated and prepared to build a Zion society where we are of one heart and one mind.</p>
