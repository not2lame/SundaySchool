                <h2>Background: The Missouri Persecutions and Liberty Jail</h2>
                <p>To understand the desperate plea, “O God, where art thou?”, we must understand the circumstances that prompted it. The revelations in Doctrine and Covenants 121, 122, and 123 were not received in a peaceful setting but were extracted from letters the Prophet Joseph Smith wrote while imprisoned in the dungeon of Liberty Jail during the brutal winter of 1838–39.</p>
                <p>This imprisonment was the culmination of the 1838 Mormon War in Missouri. Escalating tensions between the Latter-day Saints and their neighbors over religious, economic, and political differences had erupted into open conflict. The situation became dire on October 27, 1838, when Missouri’s governor, Lilburn W. Boggs, issued Executive Order 44, infamously known as the “Extermination Order.” It declared that the Saints were enemies of the state and “must be exterminated or driven from the State.”</p>
                <p>Just days later, the horrific Haun’s Mill Massacre occurred, where a state militia killed 17 Latter-day Saint men and boys in a brutal surprise attack. Shortly after, Joseph Smith and other Church leaders were betrayed, arrested, and charged with treason. A court-martial illegally ordered their execution, but Alexander Doniphan, a brigadier general in the state militia, courageously refused to carry out the order. Instead, Joseph and his companions were sent to Liberty Jail to await trial, where they languished for four agonizing months in a small, unheated, and filthy dungeon.</p>
                
                <h2>Introduction: The Lessons from Liberty Jail</h2>
                <h3>Discussion Point:</h3>
                <p>The introduction establishes a scene of profound suffering and apparent hopelessness. The Prophet Joseph Smith, imprisoned in a cold, filthy dungeon, received news of his people being driven from their homes. His desperate cry, “O God, where art thou?” is one of the most relatable moments in scripture. This lesson explores the powerful, hope-filled answers that came from God in this darkest of moments, teaching that even in our deepest despair, God is with us.</p>
                <h3>Discussion Question:</h3>
                <p>Why do you think it is valuable for us to have a record of a prophet of God experiencing such deep despair and questioning God's presence?</p>
                <div class="possible-answers">
                    <p><strong>Possible Answers:</strong> It validates our own feelings when we suffer. It shows that having questions or feeling abandoned during a trial is a human experience and not a sign of weak faith. It makes the subsequent revelations more powerful because they are born from a place of authentic anguish, demonstrating that God hears us even when we feel most alone.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>With God, adversity can “be for [my] good.”</h2>
                <h3>Discussion Point:</h3>
                <p>The Lord’s response to Joseph’s plea does not immediately remove the trial. Instead, He reframes it. He promises that Joseph's afflictions will be but a "small moment" and that if he "endure[s] it well," God will exalt him. In Section 122, the Lord puts all mortal suffering into perspective by comparing it to the suffering of the Savior, reminding Joseph that "the Son of Man hath descended below them all." This teaches us that the purpose of adversity is not just to be endured, but to be a refining experience that gives us experience and is ultimately for our good.</p>
                <blockquote>Doctrine and Covenants 121:7-8: "My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment; And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes."</blockquote>
                <h3>Discussion Question:</h3>
                <p>The Lord promises that if we "endure it well," our trials will be for our good. What do you think it means to "endure it well"? What is the difference between simply surviving a trial and enduring it well?</p>
                <div class="possible-answers">
                    <p><strong>Possible Answers:</strong> Enduring it well implies more than just waiting for it to be over. It suggests actively seeking to learn, maintaining faith even when it's difficult, continuing to serve others, and striving to find God's hand in the experience. The difference is turning to God in our suffering, rather than turning away from Him.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h2>True power and influence are based on “the principles of righteousness.”</h2>
                <h3>Discussion Point:</h3>
                <p>In a stark contrast to the unjust worldly power that imprisoned him, Joseph learns about God's power. The Lord teaches that priesthood power—the power of heaven—cannot be controlled or handled in unrighteousness. It can only be maintained through Christlike attributes like persuasion, long-suffering, gentleness, meekness, and love unfeigned. This is the only way to have true, lasting influence for good in the lives of others, especially our families.</p>
                <blockquote>Doctrine and Covenants 121:41-42: "No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned; By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy, and without guile—"</blockquote>
                <h3>Discussion Question:</h3>
                <p>These verses provide a divine blueprint for righteous influence in any leadership role (parent, ministering brother/sister, teacher, etc.). Why are worldly methods of control (force, manipulation, criticism) ultimately destructive to relationships, and why are Christlike attributes so powerful in building them?</p>
                <div class="possible-answers">
                    <p><strong>Possible Answers:</strong> Worldly methods are based on fear and coercion, which destroy trust and agency. Christlike attributes are based on love and respect, which invite the Spirit and create an environment where people want to change and improve. They build up the soul, whereas worldly methods diminish it.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Jesus Christ has descended below all things so that He can lift me up.</h2>
                <h3>Discussion Point:</h3>
                <p>The climax of the Lord's comfort to Joseph is the reminder of His Atonement. After listing a catalog of potential sufferings, the Lord declares, "The Son of Man hath descended below them all. Art thou greater than he?" (D&C 122:8). This truth puts our personal suffering into an eternal perspective. Because Christ has experienced the depth of every pain, injustice, and sorrow, He has perfect empathy for us. He knows exactly how to succor, or run to, our aid. His descent gives Him the perfect power to lift us up.</p>
                <blockquote>Doctrine and Covenants 122:8: "The Son of Man hath descended below them all. Art thou greater than he?"</blockquote>
                <h3>Discussion Question:</h3>
                <p>How does knowing that the Savior has "descended below all things" change how you view your personal trials and weaknesses?</p>
                <div class="possible-answers">
                    <p><strong>Possible Answers:</strong> It removes the feeling that we are truly alone in our suffering. It gives us confidence that there is no pain we can experience that He doesn't understand perfectly. It changes prayer from a desperate cry into a conversation with someone who truly gets it. It gives us hope that because He overcame the worst of everything, He can and will help us overcome our own challenges.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>“Let us cheerfully do all things that lie in our power.”</h2>
                <h3>Discussion Point:</h3>
                <p>After receiving these profound revelations, Joseph's focus shifts from his own suffering to the work that still needs to be done. He instructs the Saints not to be idle, but to gather affidavits and document the persecutions they have suffered. His counsel is a powerful call to action: "let us cheerfully do all things that lie in our power; and then may we stand still, with the utmost assurance, to see the salvation of God." We are not expected to do God's work for Him, but we are expected to do our part with diligence and cheerfulness.</p>
                <blockquote>Doctrine and Covenants 123:17: "Therefore, dearly beloved brethren, let us cheerfully do all things that lie in our power; and then may we stand still, with the utmost assurance, to see the salvation of God, and for his arm to be revealed."</blockquote>
                <h3>Discussion Question:</h3>
                <p>What is the relationship between doing "all things that lie in our power" and then being able to "stand still" with assurance? Why is it important that we do our part "cheerfully"?</p>
                <div class="possible-answers">
                    <p><strong>Possible Answers:</strong> Doing our part demonstrates our faith and agency. It's only after we have exhausted our own efforts that we can truly and faithfully turn the outcome over to God. Acting cheerfully shows our trust in God—that we believe in His promises and are optimistic about His power, regardless of the immediate difficulty. It is an expression of faith, not of circumstance.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Summary of "O God, Where Art Thou?"</h2>
                <p>This lesson, drawn from Joseph Smith's letters while imprisoned in the miserable conditions of Liberty Jail, explores how we can find God and purpose in our deepest trials. It begins with Joseph's desperate cry, “O God, where art thou?”, a question we all ask when suffering. The Lord's answer provides a profound eternal perspective: our afflictions are but a “small moment,” designed to give us experience and be for our good. The ultimate comfort comes from knowing the Savior, Jesus Christ, has “descended below them all,” meaning He perfectly understands our suffering and can lift us up. The lesson then contrasts the unjust power of the world with the “powers of heaven.” True priesthood power and righteous influence cannot be maintained through force or control, but only through Christlike attributes like persuasion, gentleness, and love. Finally, after receiving this divine comfort and instruction, the focus shifts to action. We are taught to “cheerfully do all things that lie in our power” to help build God's kingdom, and then to “stand still, with the utmost assurance,” to trust that God will reveal His power and accomplish His work.</p>
