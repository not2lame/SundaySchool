    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is now a four-part SPA. A main landing page offers "Daily Devotional," "Youth Devotionals," "Musical Companion," and "Weekly Study Companion." The new Youth section is self-contained and features its own sub-navigation ("Young Men" / "Young Women"), preventing information overload. This structure cleanly separates adult, youth, musical, and in-depth study materials, allowing each user group to navigate directly to relevant content. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The application now integrates four distinct content types. 1) Adult, YM, and YW Devotional Views: Use a consistent tab-based, interactive structure for daily engagement. 2) Musical Companion: Also uses a daily tabbed view for focused listening. 3) Weekly Study Companion View: Uses structured, semantic HTML for long-form reading. Interaction: A primary JS view switcher manages navigation between the four main experiences. Justification: This tailored structure provides the right interface for each content type and audience, enhancing usability and clarity. Library/Method: Vanilla JS for all interactions, Tailwind CSS for styling. -->

                <p class="text-center text-stone-600 mb-6">This guide is designed to help class members apply the principles from these sections to their own lives and to be better prepared to contribute to the class discussion.</p>

                <h2>Introduction: "I Will Order All Things for Your Good"</h2>
                <h3>Discussion Point:</h3>
                <p>The introduction contrasts the spiritual highs of the Kirtland Temple dedication with the subsequent financial and social trials that tested the Saints' faith. It frames the lesson around the vital question of how to maintain faith when adversity strikes, which is a universal challenge for all disciples of Christ.</p>
                <h3>Discussion Question:</h3>
                <p>The manual asks, "how can we keep [trials] from threatening our faith and testimony?" What have you found helps you bridge the gap between a powerful spiritual experience and the difficult realities that often follow?</p>
                <div class="possible-answers">
                    <p><strong>Possible Answers:</strong> Personal prayer, consistent scripture study, actively remembering past spiritual experiences, serving others, and trusting in the Lord's counsel are all crucial. It's often less about avoiding trials and more about how we are spiritually prepared to face them. Following the Lord's counsel in these sections—to be humble, purify our hearts, and not rebel—provides a divine pattern for enduring well.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Doctrine and Covenants 111: The Lord can “order all things for [my] good.”</h2>
                <h3>Discussion Point:</h3>
                <p>Joseph Smith and other leaders were deeply concerned about the Church's debts. In response to their anxiety, the Lord reassured them, promising to order all things for their good and revealing that there were "treasures" beyond just money to be found in their journey.</p>
                <blockquote>Matthew 6:19–21, 33: "Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. ... But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you."</blockquote>
                <h3>Discussion Question 1:</h3>
                <p>The Lord told Joseph to "be not concerned about your debts" and promised to "order all things for your good" (D&C 111:5, 11). How can we apply this counsel when facing our own significant financial or temporal worries?</p>
                <div class="possible-answers">
                    <p><strong>Possible Answers:</strong> This is a call to shift our perspective from consuming worry to active faith. It doesn't mean we should be irresponsible, but that our primary focus should remain on the Lord's work and His will. When we do our part, we can trust that He will provide a way, even if it's not the way we expect. It is about prioritizing spiritual "treasures" over worldly ones.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>Discussion Question 2:</h3>
                <p>What kind of "treasures" (verse 10) might the Lord have been referring to, beyond the "treasure of gold and silver" they were seeking? How has the Lord helped you find unexpected "treasures" during times of trial?</p>
                <div class="possible-answers">
                    <p><strong>Possible Answers:</strong> The treasures could be stronger faith, greater humility, deeper relationships with family and God, increased wisdom, or new opportunities to serve. Often, the very challenges we face become the means by which the Lord blesses us with these more valuable, eternal treasures that cannot be bought.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Doctrine and Covenants 112:3–15, 22: The Lord will lead me as I humbly seek His will.</h2>
                <h3>Discussion Point:</h3>
                <p>Thomas B. Marsh's pride was hurt by a perceived slight to his authority. The Lord's revelation to him is a powerful and timeless lesson on humility, avoiding the spirit of rebellion, and the blessings of being led by the hand of God.</p>
                <h3>Discussion Question 1:</h3>
                <p>What does it mean to you to be led "by the hand" by the Lord (verse 10)? How does humility make us more receptive to that guidance in our marriages, our parenting, and our callings?</p>
                <div class="possible-answers">
                    <p><strong>Possible Answers:</strong> Being led by the hand implies a close, personal, and gentle guidance. It suggests trust and a willingness to be dependent on a higher power. Humility is the key that unlocks this guidance because it removes our pride, our insistence on our own way, and our belief that we know best. When we are humble, we are open to correction, willing to listen to a spouse's counsel or a child's insight, and patient for the Lord's timing.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>Discussion Question 2:</h3>
                <p>The Lord counseled Thomas, "Rebel not against my servant Joseph" (verse 15). How can we sustain our leaders and avoid a spirit of rebellion or criticism, especially when we may not understand or agree with a decision at the ward or stake level?</p>
                <div class="possible-answers">
                    <p><strong>Possible Answers:</strong> Sustaining leaders means giving them the benefit of the doubt, praying for them, and seeking to understand the Lord's will through their counsel. It requires humility to accept that we don't have all the information or the same stewardship. We can express concerns through proper channels, but we avoid public criticism or contention, which are tools of the adversary used to create disunity.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Doctrine and Covenants 112:12–26, 28, 33–34: Those who are truly converted come to know Jesus Christ.</h2>
                <h3>Discussion Point:</h3>
                <p>Even those in the highest positions of Church leadership can have their faith tested and falter. This section emphasizes that a true, lasting conversion is a deeply personal responsibility focused on knowing Jesus Christ, not on our position, knowledge, or past experiences.</p>
                <h3>Discussion Question 1:</h3>
                <p>The Lord warns the Twelve, "after your temptations, and much tribulation, behold, I, the Lord, will feel after you" (D&C 112:13). What does this teach us about the refining process and the Lord's role in it?</p>
                <div class="possible-answers">
                    <p><strong>Possible Answers:</strong> This teaches that trials and temptations are an expected, even necessary, part of discipleship. They are not a sign of the Lord's displeasure but are opportunities for growth. The promise that He will "feel after" us shows His deep, personal concern. He doesn't abandon us in our trials; He is waiting to lift us up as we turn to Him after we have been tested.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>Discussion Question 2:</h3>
                <p>What does it mean to have our hearts "purified" (verse 28)? Why is this essential for a deep and lasting conversion that can withstand the tests of time?</p>
                <div class="possible-answers">
                    <p><strong>Possible Answers:</strong> Purifying our hearts means cleansing them of pride, envy, selfishness, doubt, and impure motives. It's an ongoing process of aligning our desires with God's desires through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. A lasting conversion cannot be built on a foundation of impure motives. When our hearts are pure, our actions are driven by love for God and our fellow man, and our testimony becomes unshakable.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h2>Doctrine and Covenants 113: Joseph Smith was “a servant in the hands of Christ.”</h2>
                <h3>Discussion Point:</h3>
                <p>In a time of intense turmoil and apostasy in Kirtland, the Lord reaffirmed Joseph Smith's divine calling by clarifying an ancient prophecy from Isaiah. This revelation identified Joseph as a key servant in the latter-day gathering, providing a stabilizing anchor of truth for the faithful Saints.</p>
                 <blockquote>Isaiah 11:1, 10: "And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots: ... And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and his rest shall be glorious."</blockquote>
                <h3>Discussion Question 1:</h3>
                <p>The Lord explains that the "rod" from the stem of Jesse is "a servant in the hands of Christ" (D&C 113:4). How can this truth, and knowing that we have a living prophet today who is also a servant in Christ's hands, strengthen our faith during times of personal or public turmoil?</p>
                <div class="possible-answers">
                    <p><strong>Possible Answers:</strong> It gives us an anchor in a chaotic world. It reminds us that God is in charge and that His work is directed through chosen servants according to a divine plan set forth anciently. When the world is confusing or our own faith is wavering, we can trust that the Lord is leading His Church through His prophet. This provides stability, direction, and peace.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>Discussion Question 2:</h3>
                <p>How does participating in the "gathering of [the Lord's] people in the last days" (verse 6) help us stay strong and overcome our own trials?</p>
                <div class="possible-answers">
                    <p><strong>Possible Answers:</strong> When we are engaged in the Lord's work—whether through missionary work, temple and family history work, or ministering to others—our own problems are often put into a larger, eternal perspective. Service takes us outside of ourselves. It invites the Spirit, strengthens our testimony, and reminds us that we are part of something much bigger and more glorious than our own individual struggles.</p>
